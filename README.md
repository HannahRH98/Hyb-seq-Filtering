# Hyb-seq-Filtering
Custom R script for filtering Hyb-seq data

These scripts are designed to use the outputs of the hybpiper_stats command to help decide on the best sample and gene filtering strategies.

It is important to emphasise that these scripts are GUIDES only, and the decision to remove samples or genes should also be made based upon importance of samples/genes and questions
being asked by the researchers.

We are happy for users to suggest improvements.

Happy filtering!
